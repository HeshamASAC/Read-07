BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS

RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES:

1-The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.'

2-The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.

3-You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.

4-All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.

5-All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.

6-If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).



*A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.

*Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.

*Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

*Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
